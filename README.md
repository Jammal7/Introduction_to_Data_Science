This repository contains all the resources and materials I am using to learn data science and machine learning. It includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover various topics such as data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

## Programming Language

The main programming language used in this repository is Python. Jupyter Notebook is used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
